Place thumbnail images here (e.g., `thumb.jpg`).

Steps:
1. Add `assets/thumb.jpg` (suggested size ~150×100 for thumbnails).
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Re-run the app with `flutter run`.

If you don't have thumbnails yet, you can create small placeholder images named `thumb.jpg` inside this `assets/` folder.
