Place your video thumbnail images here and name them `thumb1.jpg`, `thumb2.jpg`, ..., `thumb5.jpg`.

Steps:
1. Add images `assets/thumbs/thumb1.jpg` through `assets/thumbs/thumb5.jpg` (suggested ~150×100 px).
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Re-run the app with `flutter run` to see thumbnails in the horizontal list.

If an image is missing, the app will show a gray placeholder with a broken-image icon.
